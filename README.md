# Activity Classification Using In-Ear Wearables


# Project Overview

The goal of our project is to utilize the eSense Earable device and other wearable devices, such as a wrist band, to classify and detect a set of user activities, such as smoking or drinking. Input data will be recorded from the microphone and 6-axis intertial measurement unit (IMU) in the eSense device, and IMU in the wrist band. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be utilized for activity classification. A method of storing user activity data will also be implemented, allowing data analysis such as activity frequency and temporal patterns.
